/** @defgroup Testers Tester classes
    Tester classes represent a simple predefined interface of the user
    program. They help the user in debugging the code, adjusting the
    techniques, and tuning the parameters.  Testers also allow the
    user to instruct the system to perform massive batch
    experiments, and collect the results in aggregated form.
