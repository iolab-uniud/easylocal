How to install EasyLocal++.

The classes composing EasyLocal++ framework are of two types:

- template-free classes (mainly utility classes), which have to be independently
	compiled and form the libEasyLocal++ library;
- template classes, whose source code (contained in a set of include files) 
  have to be compiled against the actual EasyLocal++ application.

In order to install EasyLocal++ the user is required to configure the whole
system (by means of the `configure' script), to build the library and to
install the template classes include files.
The steps for doing that are the following:

- run "./configure" with the options set appropriately for your installation
  (see 'CONFIGURE' note below)

- run "make" 

- OPTIONAL: run "make check" if you want to perform some checks (namely unit testing 
  the nQueens application)
	
- OPTIONAL: run "make doxygen-doc" if you want to build the documentation (Doxygen, 
  see http://www.doxygen.org, is needed to be installed on your system)

- run "make install"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONFIGURE: a set of options can be passed to the `configure' script. Among others
the main ones are the following (a * indicates the default value):

- --enable-debug, --disable-debug*: asks to compile the library part of the 
  framework without optimization and including the debug informations.

- --enable-threading*, --disable-threading: sets up the system to enable
  the multi-threading capabilities.
	
- --enable-cpu-time*, --disable-cpu-time: sets up the system to employ
  cpu time instead of wall-clock time for computing timeouts.
