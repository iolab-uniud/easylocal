       RCL (Restricted Candidate List), a solution element (e.g. be a boolean
       variable in the case of SAT) to set in the initial solution. The RCL contains
       the best components to set based on a greedy policy. In order to increase
       the number of optimal initial solutions and to improve the overall GRASP
       procedure, the RCL should contain more than the greedy component; @c alpha
       and @c k are used to control how many other components are included in
       the RCL.
       In particular, if the greedy component has value @c p, by setting @c alpha
       we can include in the RCL also components which has a value greater than
       @c alpha * @c p.
       Pretty much in the same way, @c k can be used to restrict the RCL to the
       best @c k components according to the greedy policy. In principle @c alpha
       and @c k should be used alternatively.
